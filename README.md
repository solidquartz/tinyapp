# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

It is Aky Mac Donald's first ever full stack application, and their second project created as part of the Web Development Bootcamp at Lighthouse Labs. The focus was on constructing the backend from scratch. It features user permissions, the ability to share shortURLs with anyone, and editing and deleting URLs. Security features such as hashed passwords and encrypted cookies have been implemented, as well as tests using mocha chai.
